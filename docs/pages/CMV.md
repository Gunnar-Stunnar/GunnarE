# Celluar Music Visualizer

Initally built off of the work
[Self-Organizing Texture](https://distill.pub/selforg/2021/textures/), I created a sound visualizer that reacts in an organic way to the music being played. I provided this to friends, DJs, and other hobbyist around Boulder to use in their shows and projects. This took me about 1 hour to develop and is a work in progress.
