I would do reserach into complex NLP task to find if tricks exist that could eneable realtime predictions for help desk employees helping customers. By the end of the internship I was working with BERT, a text encoding model, to classify questions and context of questions preposed by clients to help desk workers.   

## Qusic

Qusic was my first ever mobile app I built. It enabled users to queue songs are parties in resturants all with out interacting with the DJ. I did a small launch of the app and had the app grow to 200 users organically in the first month. I had to shut it down after awhile for school was going on and I could not maintaine it. Some awesome ideas I was figuring out how were how to make it all hands free. I user could walk into a bar or resturant and the playlist is curated to who is at the location. I was able to derive the math and techniques to do such thing.
