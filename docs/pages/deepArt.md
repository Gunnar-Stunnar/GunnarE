# DeepArt - creative outlet

 ## Overview

 This is a special project I started in highschool and have worked on when I am bored or looking for a creative touch to life. I use various tools like Deep Style, Deep Dream, Photoshop, and Disco Gan to make expressive works of art. I intially started to develop my art for products in a store called Flux which was later remastered into an online store I developed called Dayzzed. Dayzzed was the name of a more serious version of Flux that was selling high end pieces. Over the course of several years I made a fully automated dropshipping store that I could leave alone and my art would sell with no input from me. Below are a few of the works!
